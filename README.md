## FAQ
### Why haven't my messages been sent?
There are a few possibilities:
* Your list does not have any contacts on it
* You have not set up a `cron` job. If you prefer, you may send the next chunk manually with `ql delivery:send`.
* Quicklist attempts to send messages spaced out evenly within your hourly send limit. To check the status of your message sending, use `ql message:status <message-id>`.
